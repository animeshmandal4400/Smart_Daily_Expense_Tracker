# Smart Daily Expense Tracker

### App Overview
Smart Daily Expense Tracker is a multi-screen expense module built with Jetpack Compose, Room, and Hilt using a clean MVVM architecture. It lets users add expenses quickly, browse and filter past records, and view a simple weekly report with category breakdowns.
The app includes three screens: Expense Entry, Expense List with grouping/filtering, and a mock Reports view with export/share simulations.

### AI Usage Summary
- I used **Figma AI** to quickly create initial UI designs, choose color palettes, and get layout inspiration before starting development.
- **Cursor** helped me set up and refine the MVVM architecture, manage safe code refactors, and make quick edits across UI components, ViewModels, DAOs, and navigation.
- **ChatGPT** was my go-to for reviewing requirements, and helping me write/iterate on Compose UI, Room queries, and ViewModel logic for validation, grouping, date handling, and export simulations. It also provided mock data for testing and improving the app during development.
- AI helped me polish the project by pointing out improvements like aligning category constants, unifying currency formats, and handling ‚Äútoday‚Äù based on local time. It even assisted in drafting this README.

### Prompt Logs (key prompts)
- Design a modern mobile app UI in Material You style for a ‚ÄúSmart Daily Expense Tracker‚Äù targeted at small business owners. The app should have three main screens: 1. Expense Entry Screen: Header: ‚ÄúTotal Spent Today: ‚ÇπXXXX‚Äù (real-time indicator) Form fields: Title (text field, required) Amount (numeric field, required, ‚Çπ prefix) Category (dropdown: Staff, Travel, Food, Utility) Notes (max 100 chars, small text field) Receipt Image (upload button or image preview) Submit button: Rounded, primary color, with an add icon Smooth entry animation when an expense is added Light & dark theme previews 2. Expense List Screen: Default view: Today‚Äôs expenses in a scrollable list Filters: Date picker for previous days Group toggle: ‚ÄúBy Category‚Äù / ‚ÄúBy Time‚Äù Each expense card: Category icon, title, amount, date/time Top bar: Total expenses count + total amount Empty state illustration for no data 3. Expense Report Screen: Title: ‚ÄúWeekly Expense Report‚Äù Show daily totals in a bar or line chart (7 days) Category-wise totals Export button: PDF/CSV share button General Style: Clean, minimalist, and intuitive Use a soft color palette with clear category color-coding Consistent rounded corners (8‚Äì12px) Icons for categories (Staff, Travel, Food, Utility) Apply Material Design typography hierarchy Include both light mode and dark mode Output: Mobile screen mockups in portrait mode Show all three screens side-by-side Provide clickable prototype flow from entry ‚Üí list ‚Üí report"
- Compose a form to add an expense with fields: Title, Amount (‚Çπ prefix), Category (Staff, Travel, Food, Utility), Notes (<=100 chars), and a mocked ‚ÄúUpload Receipt‚Äù button. Include validation states and a primary submit button with a subtle press animation.
- Set up a bottom bar NavHost with three destinations: Entry, List, Report. Use route constants, restore state when switching tabs, and make Entry the start destination. Provide a concise example with `NavigationBarItem`s.
